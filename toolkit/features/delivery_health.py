"""Report a delivery workflow whose latest run never started (#1682, #1666's AC3).

A `startup_failure` creates no job. No job means no check run, which means no
annotation and nothing red on any commit or pull request. `staging-deploy.yml`
failed that way sixteen times out of sixteen between 2026-06-18 and 2026-08-25
and `apps/api/**` reached staging exactly never in those ten weeks, while every
pipeline anyone looked at was green. Measured on run `32815342422`:

    check-suites/88893127233/check-runs  -> total_count 0
    commits/dced2265/check-runs          -> length 0

GitHub's explanation of the failure exists only in the web UI and is not
reachable from the API at all. What *is* reachable is the verdict, on
`GET /actions/workflows/<file>/runs`. Nothing read it. This module does.

**Deliberately not "alert on any failed run."** An ordinary red run already
reports itself through checks and needs no second channel. The entire value here
is the one conclusion that reports itself nowhere.

Scope, derived rather than listed
---------------------------------
A workflow is watched when it is **unattended** — *no* path into it is gated by a
pull request — **and** it reaches `ci-publish.yml` or `toolkit deployment
promote` through an executable step.

The first half is a "no", not a "some": a workflow triggered by both `push` and
`pull_request` is attended, because a `startup_failure` there leaves a pull
request without its required contexts and branch protection refuses it. The
question is always *does anything else already report this*, never *does it touch
delivery*.

Both halves were arrived at by measurement, and both exclude something a simpler
rule got wrong:

* A `workflow_call`-only file has **no runs of its own**. Measured 2026-09-06:
  `ci-publish.yml` and `ci-pipeline.yml` both report `total_count: 0`, because a
  reusable workflow's jobs appear under its caller's run. #1682's AC1 originally
  listed `ci-publish.yml`; watching it would report "never ran" forever. It is
  also unnecessary — a reusable workflow cannot `startup_failure` on its own, it
  fails as *the caller's* `startup_failure`. That is exactly #1666, where
  `staging-deploy.yml` was refused over what `ci-publish.yml`'s job requested.
  Watching the callers is therefore both necessary and sufficient.

* Reading the file as text matches prose. A grep for `deployment promote`
  matched `pr-agent.yml`, where the string sits in a comment. Steps are read
  from the parsed document, and `uses:` is resolved to the called file.

`ci.yml` publishes transitively and runs on push, and is still **excluded**: it
produces the required `Validate` and `Detect Changes` contexts, so a
`startup_failure` there blocks the very next pull request. Its silence is bounded
by one PR rather than by ten weeks, which is the same reason
`review-attestation.yml` is out. The cut is "does anything else already make this
loud", not "does it touch delivery".

The watcher watches itself
--------------------------
`SELF` is in the watched set by name, because the predicate cannot reach it: a
checker that only reads other workflows is silent about its own
`startup_failure`, which would reproduce the defect it closes one level up. This
is the one hand-written entry and it is deliberate; `tests/` pins the reason so
it is not "tidied away" as an inconsistency later.
