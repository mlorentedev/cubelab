"""APP-CONFIG-014 (#1705): n8n's environment satisfies what its Code nodes need.

`multi-forge-sync` read its HMAC secret from `$env` and n8n blocks Code-node access
to `$env` by default (`N8N_BLOCK_ENV_ACCESS_IN_NODE`, true since n8n v20). The node
threw on the first read, so the workflow failed at its FIRST Code node -- before the
signature check, before routing, before the project lookup. Measured across every
rotated event log in prod: `workflow.success` for that workflow = 0, ever, against
6008 for `notify-router`. The integration never ran once.

Nothing reported it. The webhook answers 200 to an unsigned request, to a
bad-signature request, and to its own crash, because n8n's Respond node is not what
emits that status on a failed run. A green delivery in Gitea, an active workflow and
a healthy pod were all true the whole time.

THE REQUIREMENT IS DERIVED FROM THE WORKFLOWS, NOT COPIED FROM THE MANIFEST. A test
holding its own list of required keys passes when the manifest matches the list and
says nothing about whether the list still matches what the workflows do. So this
reads the committed workflow JSON, extracts what its Code nodes actually reference,
and asserts the RENDERED ConfigMap satisfies exactly that (lesson-416). Add a
workflow that touches `$env` or `require`s a new builtin and this fails until the
environment is declared for it.

Rendered, not read from the source file, for the reason `test_vikunja_registration_
render.py` gives at length: prod merges its own overrides on top, and a merge that
stops applying is invisible to every file-reading check.
