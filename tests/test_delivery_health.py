"""#1682 — the watched set is derived, and the verdicts distinguish silence.

Two things are pinned here. The **derivation** must return the delivery lanes
that actually exist in this repository, so a fifth one is either picked up
automatically or turns this red for a human to decide; and the **classification**
must keep "never ran", "still running" and "never started" apart, because
collapsing any two of them reproduces #1666 in the checker itself.
